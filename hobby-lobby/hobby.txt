Hi im Mimi, im a creative at heart and hobbies are a big part of who i am. My happy place is a mix of a chaotic kitchen and a messy art studio
 Im just as likely to be covered in flour, clay or paint as i am to be deep in a coding project. i find so much joy in the entire process of creating from shaping lumps of clay into imaginary shapes, experimenting with new dish ideas in the kitchen, to building something cool with a code. if it involves making something new then in down!!!!.
